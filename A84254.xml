            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:112430:3"/>of himſelf at <hi>Shereborn,</hi> and of Collonel <hi>Lunsford</hi> his <hi>Fire weekes,</hi> of which it is reported, he hath made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, and began to domineere in thoſe parts, till the Parliament Forces came, giving out divers ſcandalous and ſeurrolous ſpeeches, ſaying, that the would keep the Caſtle againſt 40000. Round-headed Souldiers, and that hee doth not eſteeme of ſuch a Number, and he and divers of the Cavaleers hath entred into an <hi>Oath of Aſsocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> to be true one to another, and to ſtrive to the utmoſt of their power to reſiſt all thoſe that ſhall oppoſe them, <hi>he is very reſolute.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here hath bin much pains uſed by Sir, <hi>Walter Earl,</hi> with the reſt of the <hi>Deputy Lieutenants,</hi> in raiſing of forces to go to <hi>Shereborn,</hi> but ſuch is the baſe neſſe of the Gentry and ſcandalous Miniſters, as that they will do nothing themſelves, but have diſcharged all our ſouldiers of our trayned Bands, as that very few of them will go.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:112430:3"/>
            <p> Captain <hi>Gould</hi> and Captain <hi>Sidnam</hi> made great ſhew of their forwardneſſe at the firſt, but it proved nothing but diſſembling with our <hi>Lieutenants</hi> at laſt; for they diſhcartned their ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers themſelves, and then gave out that their Souldiers would not goe: their Lieutenants and under Officers are gone from their ſervice, and have liſted themſelves under other Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and ſo have many of Captaine <hi>Sidnams</hi> ſouldiers, daring him to his face to go with them.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee the wickedneſſe of our County, <hi>occaſioned by Malignant Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, who do nothing elſe but preach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Parliament and their Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I hope the Wiſedome of that great Councell is ſuch, that they will take notice of it, and take conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent time to rid the Kingdom of them and ſet honeſter and faithfuller Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cgers in their places, that ſo Gods true Religion may once flouriſh againe in this Kingdom.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:112430:4"/>
            <p> Upon Satterday being the 2. of this inſtant month, our ſouldiers being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 500. horſe, and foot, marched out of this Town, accompanied with 900. of the Trayned Bands, and Volunteers of <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> towards <hi>Shereborn,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all very couragious and ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted ſouldiers.</p>
            <p>They was alſo accompanied with our <hi>Deputy Lieutenants,</hi> and two <hi>Barro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets of Devon,</hi> with many more of the chief Gentry of that County, there was about 200. and 50. went out of our Town, moſt of the young men being alſo gone, Mr. <hi>Hewet,</hi> Mr. <hi>Edward Daſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> Mr. <hi>William Whis, Meychant,</hi> are likewiſe gone in this ſervice, had it not bin for the forwardneſſe of <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester</hi> few of the Country would have gone.</p>
            <p>Yeſterday about two of the clock in the afternoon, the Earl of <hi>Bedford</hi> ſate down with his Forces before <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born,</hi> being a mile diſtance from the Town, having with him 28. Enſigns,
<pb facs="tcp:112430:4"/>five thouſand foot, and ſeven hundred Horſe.</p>
            <p>Our company having notice that the Earl was ſet down, marched yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day night to be there this morning. The Earl hath promiſed to ſend them 300. horſe, when they are within three miles of <hi>Shereborn,</hi> to conduct them ſafe from the Cavaleers, thoſe that came out of <hi>Devonſhire</hi> are very Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious people.</p>
            <p>It is thought that the Marqueſſe of <hi>Hartford</hi> is in the like condition that Colonell Goring is in, by reaſon of the abundance of Forces that have now beſieged him in his ſtrong hold at Shereborn Caſtle.</p>
            <p>For upon Saturday laſt, it was ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified to the Iouſe of Commons, that the Marqueſſe is compaſſed in with 4. or 5000. men, and that they could eaſily fetch him out, but that they are very unwilling to ſhed any bloud.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Devonſhire Voluateers</hi> are very reſolute, and ſtand faſt for the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

            <p> They take much courage to hear of the happy and fortunate ſucceſſe of the Parliaments forces at <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> and of the proceedings of Sir <hi>John Meldrum</hi> there.</p>
